            People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear,
            non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. River, you
            know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name.
            There's only one time I could... Don't you think she looks tired? I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on
            any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle
            and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable!
